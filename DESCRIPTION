Description: The output gap indicates the percentage difference between the actual output of an 
    economy and its potential. Since potential output is a latent process, the estimation of the 
    output gap poses a challenge and numerous filtering techniques have been proposed. RGAP 
    facilitates the estimation of a Cobb-Douglas production function type output gap, as suggested 
    by the European Commission. To that end, the non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment 
    (NAWRU) and the trend of total factor productivity (TFP) can be estimated in two bivariate 
    unobserved component models by means of Kalman filtering and smoothing. RGAP features a 
    flexible modeling framework for the appropriate state-space models and offers frequentist as 
    well as Bayesian estimation techniques.
